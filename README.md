<h1 style="border-bottom: 1px solid gray;" id='problem'>Problem Statement</h1>

<p>
    Oftentimes, the best or most interesting ideas cross our minds when we too busy, or unable to act on them; in such a situation, what we need is a way to write down those ideas and come back to them during our free times. OnTrac enables this, and helps you stay focused on the most important stuff by offering the following solutions:
</p>

- Write your daily tasks and get timely reminder about those tasks

- Mark a task/note as important so that it always appears before the other less important once

- Add notes on one device and continue from where you stopped from any device - all your notes/tasks synced across all your devices

- Guest mode; for you to try it out and be convinced before sharing your details with us

<h1 style="border-bottom: 1px solid gray;" id='features'>Key Features</h1>

- Toggle a task as either completed or not; and delete completed tasks

- Offline functionality; so you can still use them app, even without internet connection

- Edit/delete notes seamlessly

- Guest account; users can log into the app without creating an account by using the anonymous login functionality

<h1 style="border-bottom: 1px solid gray;" id='target'>Target Audience</h1>

- Writers who want to efficiently track their jdaily activities, write down ideas as they pop up, and stay organized.

<h1 style="border-bottom: 1px solid gray;" id='requirement'>Project Requirements</h1>

- The web app would work offline, ensuring users can access their information even without an internet connection.

- Users can login anonymously and interact with the app, and "upgrade" to a standard account with all the user data intact

- The app should send push notifications providing reminders for uncompleted tasks

Aside from helping writers (like myself) to stay more productive, this project was meant to test my knowledge of different concepts in web development, precisely related to React.

So far, I am yet to come across any good speech recognition API (apart from Google Speech API which I am unable to set up due to some challenges), therefore I have put the feature on hold for now.
